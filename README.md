MobAge
======

A Bukkit plugin that gets brings mobs closer to players

We've changed the original implementation removing some stuff and added a 'real feel' to the plugin by using this PR on spigot: https://github.com/SpigotMC/Spigot-Server/pull/71

This change enables real mob ages, even after server restarts.
